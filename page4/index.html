<p>Its important to understand that I am not talking about “breaking” as in broken, I am talking about breaking as in “breaking in horses”. When a horse is wild, its difficult to ride and it needs to be “broken in” before it rides nicely and I think that the same things is true of the Internet and actually our whole world. In other words, all techies are like “code breakers” where what their ultimate job becomes is to “break in” code so that it plays nicely for end users. That is why I called this project “code breakers” so that it can be a place to host open source projects that have been “broken in” hopefully to the point where the code is relatively mature and therefore operates nicely for users in the same way that a horse that has been broken in rides nicely for its rider.</p>

<p>So, the point is, in the same way that some people work as “horse breakers” taking the wildness out of the horse so that it rides nicely for its riders, so it is that here I want to put forward the idea that these projects help to take the wildness out of the Internet so that “vulnerable” or “inexperienced” people who might not be able to cope with its wildness can have a nice time online rather than a scary time with all these wild and unexpected things happening, or potentially happening to them that they don’t understand.</p>

<p>I should say that I was working as a volunteer for charity to help elderly people with computers and I realised that for all the good intention a little knowledge is very dangerous. As you know, the plan for this “plan-et” has always been to have 3 world wars, W, WW, WWW and obviously we have been in the “www” phase for quite some time and so, helping elderly people and other technically vulnerable ones with computers and understanding that the Internet is a battlefield (hence the idea of cyber war), what is effectively happening is people are being put online who don’t have the skills to survive there and so the idea here is to create strictly controllled communmities and other web properties with as many attack vectors taken out of it as possible and so walk the fine line of not excluding the vulnerable from being active online but with maximum protective measure’s taken to insure that they don’t end up in a situation where their bank accounts are empty because of the lack of online safeguards.</p>

<h3 id="agile-deployment-toolkit"><a href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/">Agile Deployment Toolkit</a></h3>
<p>The Agile Deployment Toolkit is intended to be a powertool for CMS deployments to VPS systems. Like any “powertool”, you have to get used to it, and invest a bit of time to see how it works, but, in the hands of a skilled person there can be considerable advantages. I am looking for developers who want to test the toolkit in earnest so that any issues can be fleshed out.</p>
