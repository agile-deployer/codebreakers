    <h4 id="the-structural-vision-for-town-a">THE STRUCTURAL VISION FOR TOWN A</h4>

<p>What I am trying to achieve here is to treat fully featured applications as in essence “reusable” encapsulated components. What this means is that if a development team develops an application using a CMS, say Joomla, then using this toolkit that application can be deployed or “instantiated” as a reusable component at an application level. This is similar to how plugins and extensions are used as components within the CMS itself except the application itself is the component or the building block out of which business needs can be met in the same way that plugins or extensions are the reusable components out of which application needs can be met. The ultimate vision I have for this is that for a given town, you can deploy an encapsulated application or set of applications once for each postcode and then have people who live in that postcode join the community to get better organised at a local level. Lets use “Town A” as an example. You could have</p>

<h5 id="postcode0townasocialuk">postcode0.townAsocial.uk</h5>
<h5 id="postcode1townasocialuk">postcode1.townAsocial.uk</h5>
<h5 id="postcode2townasocialuk">postcode2.townAsocial.uk</h5>
<h5 id="postcode3townasocialuk">postcode3.townAsocial.uk</h5>
<h5 id="postcode4townasocialuk">postcode4.townAsocial.uk</h5>
<h5 id="postcode5townasocialuk">postcode5.townAsocial.uk</h5>

<p>And so on. You then have an umbrella or “registration website” which delegates to the appropriate encapsulated component website. So, the umbrella website might be
www.townAsocial.uk can you see how that umbrella website would delegate to each of the encapsulated child websites deployed using the Agile Deployment Toolkit. Its not there yet (2021), but, this is ultimately what I am aiming for.</p>

<p>What this means is that you could have a set of techies who are running the postcode1 website, a set of techies running the postcode2 website and so on. So, in this way, each website would be like a franchised sub component which fits into the greater scheme. This ties in with the philosophy of devolving power back to the local level or “taking back control” because the idea of “taking back control” is that it moves away from these huge centralised and remote setups such as the enormous social networks that we have seen so far and makes it possible for each self contained and therefore (relatively) easily managed sub section of the greater system to operate. The techies that run postcode0 and other community support personnel wouldn’t need to know anything about the techies that run the postcode1, or the postcode2 subsection or subcomponent and yet they are tied together by the parent site www.townAsocial.uk.</p>

<p>What you could do is have representatives of the postcode1, the postcode2 and so on, websites, who are also then appointed members of a greater www.townASocial website which is only open to the annointed representatives of the child websites. These representatives can feed into the overarching website providing feedback and so on. In this way, it can help the people’s voice get heard.</p>

<p>The ADT is going to require some investment from you to be able to use. To be clear, did you expect to be able to drive your car first time, no, but, you put the effort into learning and once that effort is put in your life is better, so it is here. I think if you try out the ADT, you will see how it should be possible to make distinct deployments which all feed in to a bigger picture solution. As any designer will tell you, there’s two approaches to be able to structure a solution, the top down approach and the bottom up approach. The problem with the top down apporach is that you have the roof on before the foundations and that can be a huge source of problems and this solution is very much a bottom up approach, the very bottom in fact, and hopefully, that is what means that the foundation is the priority of it. From my point of view, I have made this as good as I can make it, but, its still going to have to be put through its paces in real world scenarios. I think what I have built is realtively strong, but, I’ll leave it to you to confirm that.</p>

<p>I think that’s the key vision that I had and I think you can see the structure that I am suggesting. In a lot of ways, this is the natural direction that Brexit was heading in which means giving up more central control for more local control and in so doing restore or rekindle a more bottom up approach to government. We have gone very big with our ideas forgetting that big things are made out of small parts. This toolkit is intended to be a little thing or a small part out of which it might be possible to build a greater structure and no so doing create or at least seed the idea of creating a technology based social skeleton so that we no longer live as social inveritbates.</p>

<p><strong>The key innovation I want to stress here because it might seem to you that using a toolkit like this is “just a hosting solution”, but, actually, the key innovation is to be able to deploy a primed and ready “plug and play” 3rd party CMS application out of the box just by changing the configuration parameters provided to this toolkit. To deploy a completely different application, say a Wordpress blog instead of a Joomla social network, once you are set up, might be as simple as changing 5 or 6 configuration parameters and hitting “build”, now, to me that is quite powerful compared to some of the other solutions I have seen and is why I consider this a powertool.</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example baselined application. I have done nothing to it except deploy it using the Agile Deployment Toolkit and so, the next thing you see after the ADT says “Build complete” is what you see in this video. Its in a private repository so it can’t be deployed by anyone, but, applications stored in public repositories or behind a paywall of some sort could be fully functional out of the box. Put it this way, if you tell the ADT install Joomla, it will install a virgin joomla if you tell it install application X it will install application X which can be reused in many different scenarios.</p>
