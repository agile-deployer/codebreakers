### A breaker is a type of wave in the ocean. What I wanted to do here was to provide a place for coding projects with the intention to act as "waves" of social improvement, hence, code breakers.

### The projects are listed below. Click the link(s) below to find out more about the particular project and how it can help you and perhaps, how you can help it.

## PROJECT 1:

### [Agile Deployment Toolkit](https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/)
The Agile Deployment Toolkit is intended to be a powertool for CMS deployments to VPS systems. Like any "powertool", you have to get used to it, and invest a bit of time to see how it works, but, in the hands of a skilled person there can be considerable advantages. I am looking for developers who want to test the toolkit in earnest so that any issues can be fleshed out.
