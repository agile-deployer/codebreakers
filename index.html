### The codebreakers project is intended to be a home for opensource projects that can be used in any community. I called this site codebreakers because I hope that users of my projects will break my code and post the issue so it can be rectified. This is how the highest quality stuff comes about, finding fault and then my naming it such is an honouring of you if you contribute in such fashion.

### The projects are listed below. Click the link(s) below to find out more about the particular project and how it can help you and perhaps, how you can help it.

## PROJECT 1:

### [Agile Deployment Toolkit](https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/)
The Agile Deployment Toolkit is intended to be a powertool for CMS deployments to VPS systems. Like any powertool, you have to get used to it, and invest a bit of time to see how it works, but, in the hands of a skilled person there can be considerable advantages.
