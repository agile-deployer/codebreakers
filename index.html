### The codebreakers project is intended to be a home for opensource projects that can be used in any community. I called this site codebreakers because I hope that users of my projects will "break my code" and post the issue on my GitHub so it can be rectified. This is how the highest quality stuff comes about, finding fault and then removing the fault and my naming it such (codebreakers) is an honouring of you if you contribute in such a fashion. I've done the best I can but there's two old fashioned sayings, 'many hands make light work' and 'too many cooks spoil the broth'. So, it's hard to know what is for the best but my calling this "codebreakers" is an invite to you, as an expert, to break my code and tell me how it failed. That way, the idea is that my work and therefore our work can be as good as it can be, and, if that's not good enough, I don't know what else to say.

### The projects are listed below. Click the link(s) below to find out more about the particular project and how it can help you and perhaps, how you can help it.

## PROJECT 1:

### [Agile Deployment Toolkit](https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/)
The Agile Deployment Toolkit is intended to be a powertool for CMS deployments to VPS systems. Like any "powertool", you have to get used to it, and invest a bit of time to see how it works, but, in the hands of a skilled person there can be considerable advantages. I am looking for developers who want to test the toolkit in earnest so that any issues can be fleshed out.
