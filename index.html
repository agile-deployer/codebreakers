#### Its important to understand that I am not talking about "breaking" as in "to be broken", I am talking about breaking as in "breaking in horses". When a horse is wild, its difficult to ride and it needs to be "broken in" before it rides nicely and I think that the same thing is true of the Internet and actually our whole world. In other words, all techies are like "code breakers" where what their ultimate job becomes is to "break in" code so that it plays nicely for end users. That is why I called this project "code breakers" so that it can be a place to host open source projects that have been "broken in" hopefully to the point where the code is relatively mature and therefore operates nicely for users in the same way that a horse that has been broken in rides nicely for its rider.  

#### I want to put forward the idea that these projects have the end objective to help to take the wildness out of the Internet so that "vulnerable" or "inexperienced" people who might not be able to cope with its wildness can have a nice time online rather than a scary time with all these wild and unexpected things happening, or, potentially happening to them. It is very well known that people who are either elderly or who have learning difficulties are ripe for exploitation online and so this is just a small effort to make that a little less the case. Its not been so clear to me in the past as to whether helping people to have a little knowledge of the Internet who previously had none is in their best interests seeing as what can befall them online when they have enough knowledge to be functional, but, not enough knowledge to be truly savvy. The idea here is to create strictly controllled communities and other web properties with as many attack vectors taken out of them as possible and so walk the "fine line" of not excluding the vulnerable from being at least partially active online but with maximum protective measures taken to ensure that they don't end up in a situation where their bank accounts are empty because of the lack usable online safeguards. My objective here is to make small enclosed communities either as social networks or for some other use case such as a blogging platform in order provide a safe space where vetted identifiable members can interact and are accountable and traceable. If this can be done then it means that it stops people being taken for a ride.

### [Open Positions](https://www.codebreakers.uk/openpositions/) 

## PROJECT 1:

### [Agile Deployment Toolkit](https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/)
#### The Agile Deployment Toolkit is intended to be a powertool for CMS deployments to VPS systems. Like any "powertool", you have to get used to it, and invest a bit of time to see how it works, but, in the hands of a skilled person there can be considerable advantages. I am looking for developers who want to test the toolkit in earnest so that any issues can be fleshed out.
