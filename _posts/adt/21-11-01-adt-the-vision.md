#### THE VISION

What I am trying to achieve here is to treat fully featured applications as reusable encapsulated components. What this means is that if a development team develops an application using a CMS, say joomla, that using this toolkit that application can be deployed or "instantiated" as a reusable component at an application level. This is similar to how plugins and extensions are used as components with the CMS itself except the application itself is the component or the building block. The ulitmate vision I have for this is that for a given town, you can deploy an application once for each postcode. Lets use Slough Town as an example. You could have

##### sl0.sloughsocial.uk  
##### sl1.sloughsocial.uk  
##### sl2.sloughsocial.uk  
##### sl3.sloughsocial.uk  
##### sl4.sloughsocial.uk  

And so on. You then have an umbrella or "registration website" which delegates to the appropriate encapsulated component website. So, the umbrella website might be
www.sloughsocial.uk can you see how that umbrella website would delegate to each of the encapsulated child websites deployed using the agile deployment toolkit. Its not there yet, but, this is ultimately what I am aiming for. 

What this means is that you could have a set of techies who are running the sl0 website, a set of techies running the sl1 website and so on. So, in this way, each website would be like a franchise sub component which fits into the greater scheme. This ties in with the philosophy of devolving power back to the local level or "taking back control" because the idea of "taking back control" is that it moves away from these huge centralised and remote setups such as the enormous social networks that we have seen so far and makes it possible for each set contained and therefore (relatively) easily managed sub section of the greater system to operate. The techies that run sl0 and other community support personel wouldn't need to know anything about the techies that run the sl1, or the sl2 subsection and yet they are tied together by the parent site www.sloughsocial.uk.

What you could do is have representatives of the sl0, the sl1 and so on websites who are also members of a greater sl website which is only open to the annointed representatives of the child websites. These representatives can feed into the overarching website providing feedback and so on. In this way, it can help the people's voice get heard. 

Also, I have put quite a bit of work into figuring out how to make these websites as secure as possible and so it means that there should be less hacking or vulnerabilties for people who are members of the community. I ain't no saint, but, I did spend some time helping people who struggle with technology to become more prophicient and I often wonder whether my efforts to help did more harm than good because, "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing", or, "I know enough to be dangerous" meaning that once people become mildly prophicient that is also the time when the danger is highest because of all the hacking attempts which they might not be savvy about. Having these enacapsulated local communities is a way of making sure that as much protecting as possible is given to people who might be vulnerable to problems in the more "wild west" environment of the larger social networks. 

I think if you try out the ADT, you will see how it should be possible to make distinct deployments which all feed in to a bigger picture solution. 

I think what I have built is realtively strong, but, it still needs to be battlehardened if you are up for that then its possible that some of your products might be used by application developers when they are building their reusable application components. In essence then this is about treating whole websites as plug and play components which can plug in to a greater system or skeleton.
