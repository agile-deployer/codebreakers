Excuse my language but as you know the bullshit in this society is escalating in incomprehensible proportions. I was a victim of it early and got it out of the way, these days, I don't give a shit because the man pointing the finger is always the lesser man. The point is, if you are happy with what you have done in life it really doesn't matter what someone else thinks, claims or says. Anyway, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but, nevertheless, even if good intentions do lead us to and through hell, that doesn't mean that we should abandon our good intent. 
To make it very succinct, I have been working on a back of a fag packet, no funding, below the radar project for almost 10 years, but, something my late father told me from when he was on holiday in Lanzarote was about a local boy at the beach who all he had was a fishing line, but, he was hooking fish out of the water at a rate of knots and just along from him were these tourist blokes with all the gear, fishing lines, nets obviously loads of money and they were catching nowt. So, the point is, I might not have the resources, we might not have the resources, but, if I/we can have an iota of talent it might make up for it. That said, I am not Superman and so there are limits to what I can do and that is why I am writing this to selected people in my network. The reason why is that what I want is a troop of committed loyal ones who want to be involved in setting up social networking solutions with what might be the impossible objective of putting a skeleton into the social system that it is missing. Notice if you make an utter mess its easy for you not to be held accountable because you hide in the mess you have made, a mud fish will kick up mud so it can't be seen and there is a hell of a lot of that going on in our society. Using technology we can improve accountability at all levels. Having an invertibrate social system is hell and what I have done the system analysis based on real experience and impoverishment and the objective at least is to go one better than "customised social networking" and create "customised support networks". Its not the whole puzzle its not a magic solution but I think it can be part of an improvement. 
And so the point is, I have set up a demo (and it is only a demo) of what my software can do and am looking for interested ones who might want to partake of it and in so doing see its potential and see if it is something that can be taken forward as something coming up from the arse end of society rather than being enforced by the jackboot from above whether it fits comfortably or not.  

Don't all rush at once, seriously, I don't want the what has been a ripple of interest so far to turn into a tsunami and so in the first instance I am looking for about 20 people to put it throught its paces. And if it stands up to that working out from there.
