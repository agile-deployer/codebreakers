To make it very succinct, I have been working on a back of a fag packet, below the radar, project (as a volunteer) for almost 10 years. Something my late father told me from when he was on holiday in Lanzarote was about a local boy at the beach who all he had was a fishing line, but, he was hooking fish out of the water at a rate of knots, and, just along from him were these tourists with all the gear, fishing lines, nets obviously, loads of money, and they were catching nowt stuck on a path of endless frustration. So, the point is, I might not have the resources, we might not have the resources, but, if I/we can have an iota of talent it might make up for it. That said, I am not Superman (or if you are a Christian, Jesus) and so there are limits to what I can do and that is why I am writing this proposal. What I have seen and experienced, your experience might be different, is a vast reduction in the scale of the services that are available over the past 10 years. That's not some theory its bourne out by the actual reduction in services of which I have seen quite harmful effects on people. I want a troop of committed loyal ones who want to be involved in setting up social networking solutions with what might be the impossible objective of being more socially organised. Using technology we can improve accountability at all levels. I have done the system analysis based on real experience in the community and the objective at least is to go one better than big tech "social networking" and create "locally orientated use case tailored support networks". Its not the whole puzzle its not a magic solution but I think it can be part of an improvement.   

I have set up a demo (and it is only a demo) of what my software can do and am looking for interested ones who might want to partake of it and in so doing see its potential and see if it is something that can be taken forward as something coming up from the base of society rather than being enforced by the jackboot from above irrespective of whether it fits comfortably or not.  

Don't all rush at once, seriously, I don't want the what has been a "ripple" of interest so far to turn into a "tsunami" and so in the first instance I am looking for about 20 volunteers to put it throught its paces. And if it stands up to that and there is interest working out from there. This demo is a social networking oriented demo, but, it is possible that I might be willing to deploy blogging systems using this software so that people with something to say on issues that interest them can form groups of blogging communities. And so this demo is in no way a limit case of the type of applications that can be deployed. It does wear you down working under such austere conditions, but, you have to have the faith that if you keep putting one foot in front of the other, eventually, you will get somewhere, this is me putting my foot forward to take the next step.
