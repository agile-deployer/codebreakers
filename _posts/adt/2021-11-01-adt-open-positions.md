There is an old saying "start as you mean to go on" and for a lot of startups, often they start without much cash and then they get some cash and they lose site of old wisdom and change how they operate thinking they are on to a good thing.
My objective here is to work as "cash free" as possible for as long as possible and to make that the ethos.
This approach doesn't come without challenges because as soon as you approach most people about putting some work in the first question is, "How much are you paying mate?" which can be a blocker because as far as the word on the street goes, "more money good, less money, bad", but, there's a lot of grey area in there and you can discover that for yourself. 
So, to be very clear, you can't get blood out of a stone and so, if I haven't got money I can't pay you money, can I, but, that is not the same as there not being anything in it for you. If you haven't noticed we have gone very cellular meaning for a lot of us our houses are like little palaces our luxury cells and yet when we step outside of our front doors, society is decaying very badly to the point where there's already is very serious problems (give it another 5 years and there will be roads without any roadmarkings painted on them from what I have seen) and so, what this means is that there is a naturally reactive and counterbalancing process of communities becoming more social rather than cellular and me dedicating my life to this is a natural reaction to the mutant culture that has developed and is in play at the moment. So, I want you to ask a different question, not, "what is in this for me", but, "what is in this for society". Maybe there's nothing in it. maybe my work is a crock of shit, but, then again, maybe it isn't, lets find out?

As a first step then, these unpaid positions are open withing codebreakers.

1) Linux deployment specialists with knowledge of the Linux shell and cloud host environments for help with developing the agile deployment toolkit: [ADT](www.github.com/agile-deployer)
2) Application testers - people willing to test applications deployed using the ADT. 
3) Application developers - people willing to develop applications using the latest CMS systems deployed using the ADT such as Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal.
4) Application deployers - people willing to learn how the ADT works (the ADT is a DMS (Deployment Management System) and it is similar to the amount of effort you would put in to learning a CMS but for deployment rather than content).
