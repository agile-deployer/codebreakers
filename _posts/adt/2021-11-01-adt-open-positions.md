There is an old saying "start as you mean to go on" and for a lot of startups, often they start without much cash and then they get some cash and they lose site of old wisdom and change how they operate thinking they are on to a good thing.
My objective here is to work using fiscal leverage as little as possible (I haven't used it yet, what makes me think I will need to use it in the future)? This approach doesn't come without challenges and even risks, because, as soon as you approach most people about putting some work in the first question is, "How much are you paying mate?" which can be a blocker because as far as the word on the street goes, "more money good, less money, bad", but, there's a lot of grey area in there and you can discover that for yourself. My point is, say, I was doing a talk on online social networking at the local community hall, maybe a few oddballs would show up. But, if I was offering some huge amount like genuinely offering Â£5000 an hour to everyone that shows up "they" would be queueing down the road to get in. This is what I mean by fiscal leverage. In other words, your capacity to build is constrained by your fiscality, in a lot of cases and if you are "no good with money" that becomes the limiting factor rather than if you are "No good with art". What I wanted to do then, is, try to build something using as little fiscal leverage as possible. It does make it harder, because I could have a troop of rock star programmers already working with me, if I had the money to buy them, but, because I haven't, right now, its just me and this idea getting airbourne is proving weighty. 

I used to be a pro but I got promoted to being an amateur about 20 years ago and that is when the real work started. Amateur comes from the French word "amour" which means "for the love of" and this is a fundamental difference, as a rule a pro does it for the love of money which is undeniable a very powerful motivator in the mind, but, an amateur does it for the love of the art itself. We don't live in an amateur society (which might go a long way to explaining the chaos that exists), by and large, and the enforced wisdom is "pros are very proficient (not some of the cowboys I've seen aren't) and you take a quality risk with an amateur". This however is a psychiatric coup that people are beginning to fight off, not just me, more and more people are realising it. Working as an amateur you care about what you do as if it was your child, it might be a bad child it might not work it might have problems, but, its still your child and you love it, as a pro you care about "when is it pay day" and that's the difference. Be open to the idea that with a little bit of self belief and faith, miracles can happen and that's the "power of love or amour". The end objective is to begin to "fight off the diseased programming" that is conditioning us to believe in "upgrade to pro". Its an uphill battle because the mind is lopsided, but, maybe one day an injustice will be corrected and we will see the truth, "upgrade to amateur".

### As a first step then, these unpaid positions are open within Codebreakers.  

### If you are interested, open an issue on [this](https://github.com/agile-deployer/codebreakers/issues) repository expressing your interest. 

1) Linux deployment specialists with knowledge of the Linux shell and cloud host environments for help with developing the agile deployment toolkit: [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer)  

2) Application testers - people willing to test applications deployed using the ADT.  

3) Application developers - people willing to develop applications using the latest CMS systems deployed using the ADT such as Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal.  

4) Application deployers - people willing to learn how the ADT works (the ADT is a DMS (Deployment Management System) and it is similar to the amount of effort you would put in to learning a CMS but for deployment rather than content).
