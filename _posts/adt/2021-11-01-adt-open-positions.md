There is an old saying "start as you mean to go on" and for a lot of startups, often, they start without much finance (like me working on this) and then they get some capital and they lose sight of old wisdom and change how they operate thinking they are on to a good or better thing. It might therefore be an interesting experiment to see if this project can be gotten off the ground using as little fiscal leverage as possible. I don't know how it will play out, but, there's certainly difficulties relating to such an approach because the first question asked upon the "Would you like to work on a new startup project?" is, "How much are you paying mate?". Well, I'm not paying money, but, that's not the same thing as not paying anything at all. There's lots of ways to capitalise yourself, you can capitalise your love, you can capitalise yourself psychologically, you can capitalise yourself socially, you can capitliae yourself morally and so on. The deception is to make you think the only way of capitalising yourself is fiscally, it isn't and that is what we can find out for sure. The fiscally hijacked mind thinks that the only valid capitalisation is financial which, of course, it isn't. 

**capitalise: def: take the chance to gain advantage from**

You'll never be free of capitalism because the law is "if you over capitalise yourself in one way you will under capitalise yourself in another". What you can be free of is the psychiatric limitation which induces you into thinking that the only way to capitalise yourself is fiscal capitalisation. If you over capitalise in one way you are required to under capitalise in another and that's true of all of us, we are all "over capitalised under capitalised" people.  think that's clear to everyone take it this way to forgo it in that. Any morality in that is a delusion its not any less morale to capitalise yourself fiscally than it is to capitalise yourself in any other way. There you are, I have paid you already with psychological capitalisation , you previously thought the only way to capitalise yourself was through the bank but now you have the huge advantage of being able to see that self capitalisation is a constant it's just the style of it that varies. If you want more of that style of payment, there's open positions below. It's kinda rude to work as a volunteer and claim you have not been paid. I work as a volunteer and I am very clear about it, I have been paid its just that I have been paid psychologically rather than fiscally; remember what I told you, take it this way to forgo it that way. Start to think of everything as the banking system meaning that there's info banks, fiscal banks, tech banks, happiness banks, love banks (notice the word volunteer has the word love in it if you prefer to capitalise your love rather than your wallet), and so on. Start to think of your volunteer centre as your love bank. Everything works on the "stocks and shares" system meaning that every person you meet has stocks and how those stocks are shared is the game. The custom is for money to be involved but you can learn that there doesn't have to be. I have tech stocks here and I am offering to share it with you are you up for that?

### As a first step then, there are various opportunities to capitalise yourself within Codebreakers the style of capitalisation is an open question but chances are it won't be fiscal capitalisation. I can't say what your reward will be, but, the old saying is "there must be something in it for him (in this case you)", and, trusting that there is an unseen process that enforces that and more importantly knowing that there is, challenges us.    

### If you are keen, open an issue on [this](https://github.com/agile-deployer/codebreakers/issues) repository expressing your interest. 

1) Toolkit Developers - Very highly technical Linux deployment specialists with knowledge of the Linux shell and cloud host environments for help with developing and extending the Agile Deployment Toolkit: [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer)  

2) Application testers - Technology capable people willing to test as end users applications deployed using the ADT.  

3) Application developers - Moderately technical people willing to develop applications using the latest CMS systems deployed using the ADT such as Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal.  

4) Application deployers - Highly technical people willing to learn how the ADT works (the ADT is a DMS (Deployment Management System) and it is similar to the amount of effort you would put in to learning a CMS but for deployment rather than content).
