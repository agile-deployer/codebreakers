There is an old saying "start as you mean to go on" and for a lot of startups, often they start without much cash and then they get some cash and they lose site of old wisdom and change how they operate thinking they are on to a good thing.
My objective here is to work as "cash free" as possible for as long as possible and to make that the ethos.
This approach doesn't come without challenges because as soon as you approach most people about putting some work in the first question is, "How much are you paying mate?" which can be a blocker because as far as the word on the street goes, "more money good, less money, bad", but, there's a lot of grey area in there and you can discover that for yourself. 
So, to be very clear, you can't get blood out of a stone and so, if I haven't got money I can't pay you money, can I, but, that is not the same as there not being anything in it for you at all. If you haven't noticed we have gone very cellular. For a lot of us our houses are like little palaces, our luxury cells, and yet when we step outside of our front doors, society is decaying very badly. This means that as our nests get more comfortable society gets more uncomfortable and this means is that ultimately there is a naturally reactive and counterbalancing process of communities becoming more social rather than cellular and me dedicating my life to this is a natural reaction to the mutant culture that has developed and is in play at the moment. That's not to be judgemental its just to make a point that there's only so much comfort to go around and when we have more personal comfort it means less social comfort. So, I want you to ask a different question, not, "what is in this for me", but, "what is in this for society". Maybe there's nothing in it. maybe my work is a crock of shit, but, then again, maybe it isn't, lets find out?

I used to be a pro but I got promoted to being an amateur about 20 years ago and that is when the real work started. Amateur comes from the French word "amour" which means "for the love of" and this is a fundamental difference, as a rule a pro does it for the love of money which is undeniable a very powerful motivator in the mind, but, an amateur does it for the love of the art itself. We don't live in an amateur society (which might go a long way to explaining the choas that exists), by and large, and the enforced wisdom is "pros are very proficient (not some of the cowboys I've seen aren't) and you take a risk with an amateur". This however is a psychiatrc coup that people are beginning to fight off, not just me, more and more people are realising it. Working as an amateur you care about what you do as if it was your child, it might be a bad child it might not work it might have problems, but, its still your child and you love it, as a pro you care about "when is it pay day" and that's the difference. Be open to the idea that with a little bit of self belief and faith, miracles can happen and that's the "power of love or amour". 

As a first step then, these unpaid positions are open withing codebreakers.

1) Linux deployment specialists with knowledge of the Linux shell and cloud host environments for help with developing the agile deployment toolkit: [ADT](www.github.com/agile-deployer)  

2) Application testers - people willing to test applications deployed using the ADT.  

3) Application developers - people willing to develop applications using the latest CMS systems deployed using the ADT such as Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal.  

4) Application deployers - people willing to learn how the ADT works (the ADT is a DMS (Deployment Management System) and it is similar to the amount of effort you would put in to learning a CMS but for deployment rather than content).
