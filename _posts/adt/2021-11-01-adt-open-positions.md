There is an old saying "start as you mean to go on" and for a lot of startups, often, they start without much finance (like me working on this) and then they get some mad loot (money) and they lose sight of old wisdom and change how they operate thinking they are on to a good or better thing. There is a deceptive assumption socially which is that "money flows to good things" and therefore if it has money it is "good or better" and if it was "any good" it would "have money". I've worked professionally and I have worked in fiscally strangulated situations as a volunteer, volunteering was the higher quality. Turning people its money rats, scrabbling around for a few quid is not a constructive social policy and so the advice is don't play to it, realise that fisality is beneath you as a spiritual being, you are not beneath it. It might therefore be an interesting experiment to see if this project can be gotten off the ground using as little fiscal leverage as possible. I don't know how it will play out, but, there's certainly difficulties relating to such an approach because the first question asked upon the "Would you like to work on a new startup project?" is, "How much are you paying mate?". Well, I'm not paying money, but, that's not the same thing as not paying anything at all. Rewards can take many forms; its myopic to think that only fiscality is rewarding. Maybe if you work with me here you will be rewarded with a warm glow in your heart? We live in a system where everyone you meet is an "I've got my share, but, I want more" type of guy. We are all like that its not just you and me.   

------------------------

As a first step, then, there are various opportunities to capitalise yourself within Codebreakers; the style of capitalisation is an open question but chances are it won't be fiscal capitalisation. I can't say what your reward will be, but, the old saying is "there must be something in it for him (in this case you)", and, trusting that there is an unseen process that enforces that and more importantly knowing that there is, challenges us.    

### If you are keen, open an issue on [this](https://github.com/agile-deployer/codebreakers/issues) repository expressing your interest. 

Computer systems don't run on a wing and a prayer hardnosed engineering is required if they are to stand a chance of working or as the aircraft engineers put on the wall of Hanger 9 at Heathrow back in the day, 

**"Note to management: these aircraft do not fly on bullshit alone"**

With that in mind, then, if we are to have any chance at all of getting airbourne, metaphorically, with this project, there needs to be interest and input from highly proficient people of which I might be one. If this project doesn't get that it will be dead in the water before it even starts. 

The roles which I am looking for volunteers to fill are:  

1) Toolkit Developers - Very highly technical Linux deployment specialists with knowledge of the Linux shell and cloud host environments for help with developing and extending the Agile Deployment Toolkit: [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer)  

2) Application testers - Technology capable people willing to test as end users applications deployed using the [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer)  

3) Application developers - Moderately technical people willing to develop applications using the latest CMS systems deployed using the [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer) such as Joomla, Wordpress and Drupal.  

4) Application deployers - Highly technical people willing to learn how the [ADT](https://www.github.com/agile-deployer) works (the ADT is a DMS (Deployment Management System) and it is similar to the amount of effort you would put in to learning a CMS but for deployment rather than content).
