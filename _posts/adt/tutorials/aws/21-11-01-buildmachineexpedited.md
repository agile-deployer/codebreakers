### PRE BUILD PREPARATIONS FOR EXPEDITED AND FULL BUILDS:

Before performing an expedited or full build, you need to set up a build machine. The way you do this for AWS is as follows:

----------------

1) If you don't have an SSH key pair or if you want a specific SSH key pair for your builds, issue the following command:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
>     /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

Your key will be saved to the indicated file, for example, **/root/.ssh/id_rsa** your path might be different such as **/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa**
         
Issue the command (for example)

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   
>     /bin/cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - this will be your <ssh-public-key-substance>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   
This will give you your **public** key which you need later so, take a copy of the output that is printed to the screen.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

--------------------

2) Take a copy of the script: [Initial Script](https://github.com/agile-deployer/agile-infrastructure-build-client-scripts/blob/master/templatedconfigurations/templateoverrides/OverrideScript.sh)

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

------------------

3) If you look into the script that you made a copy of in 2, you need to populate the following variables in your copy:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     export BUILDMACHINE_USER=""
>     export BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD="" 
>     export BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT=""
>     export LAPTOP_IP=""

>     export SSH=\"\" 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
Now you need to decide on a username for your build machine, a password for your build machine, a port for your build machine's ssh system and the IP address of your desktop or laptop.

If I decide on a username of "agile-deployer" then in the copy that I made in 2, I need to change it as follows:  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

>     export BUILDMACHINE_USER="agile-deployer"

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

If I decide on a password of "QQQPPPZZZMMM123098" then in the copy that I made in 2, I need to change it as follows:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     export BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD="QQQPPPZZZMMM123098"

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

If you decide on an SSH_PORT of "1035" then in the copy that I made in 2, I need to change it as follows:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     export BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT="1035"

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

You need to give the script your laptop IP address. You can do this by going to https://www.whatsmyip.com and so, if your ip address is: "111.111.111.111" and pasting your ip address into your copy as follows:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     export LAPTOP_IP="111.111.111.111"

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

The **public** ssh key that you took a copy of in 1 needs to be pasted as follows:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     export SSH=\"<ssh-public-key-substance>\"

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

The top part of the copy that you made in 2 will now look like this:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

>     #!/bin/bash
>    
>     /bin/mkdir /root/logs
>    
>     OUT_FILE="webserver-build-out-`/bin/date | /bin/sed 's/ //g'`"
>     exec 1>>/root/logs/${OUT_FILE}
>     ERR_FILE="webserver-build-err-`/bin/date | /bin/sed 's/ //g'`"
>     exec 2>>/root/logs/${ERR_FILE}
>     
>     ###############################################################################################
>     # SET THESE FOR YOUR BUILD CLIENT MACHINE
>     # THIS WILL NOT START A BUILD IT WILL JUST SETUP THE TOOLKIT
>     # USE THIS IF YOU WANT TO PERFORM AN EXPEDITED OR A FULL BUILD FROM THE COMMAND LINE
>     # ssh -i <ssh-private-key> -p ${BUILDCLIENT_SSH_PORT} $BUILDCLIENT_USER@<buildclientip>
>     # $BUILDCLIENT_USER>sudo su
>     # password:${BUILDCLIENT_PASSWORD}
>     # cd agile-infrastructure-build-client-scripts/logs
>     #################################################################################################
>     export BUILDMACHINE_USER="agile-deployer"
>     export BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD="QQQPPPZZZMMM123098" #Make sure any password you choose is strong enough to pass any strength enforcement rules of your OS
>     export BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT="1035"
>     export LAPTOP_IP="111.111.111.111"
>      
>     /bin/echo "
>     #BASE OVERRIDES
>     export SSH=\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEgqlNPY9uh6SpihNXm/7XGqOKvAcH8Z0Y6pZG9lTIm/PHI5VijIFqs0OzM3DPLFARtut7lojBoKq9ljBmKeVBGX5EkJ5O3CJfEZs9E13e2Qk+7F9wTmoMBG8XY4l/SmD9HddLTS/7Oadg+C4RDxHlSMrl1PSCdzlM14spHCI8rwUntNCUY+fObolqel0829zYDX0oEWzYyoIEUs1847X3cRp9+yZsjqSD5Nw9jacLcWjtdfClEvx5F8ZVm0+s5OLtz9cCf6NkOgYf3KFz+e8qAO/w83Umh5B2Gem1uOxSDtUmzVlRiMTfP6CTSKRnYRnkb97F9RZsmAsG6+g+eKvp root@penguin\" #paste your public key here
>     
>     The rest of the script will appear below here

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

-----------------

4) Take a copy of this entire updated script and keep it safe because you will likely want to use this script multiple times in future deployments remember that anyone who has a copy of this script you have made has enough information to access the build machine you are going to deploy in a minute. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

---------------

5) What you need to do now is to use this script to spin up your build machine and you will do this by pasting it into the user data area of your build machine.

You will need to create a security group for your build machine. You can do this as follows:
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

>     Click on the security groups option of your aws GUI and click "Create Security Group" and call it **PRECISELY** "adt-build-machine"

![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/awstutorial/image5.png "AWS Tutorial Image 5")

You can then see your new security Group "adt-build-machine" listed  

6) Add rules to the "adt-build-machine" security group to allow pinging and your build client to connect.  

>     So you will need to add 3 rules  
>     
>     1) Ping  
>     2) A rule to allow acccess to your build machines defined SSH_PORT from your laptop.  
>        If you SSH_PORT is 1035 and your laptop IP is 111.111.111.111 then you will need a TCP rule with "CIDR 111.111.111.111/32 1035"
>     3) A rule to allow acccess to your build machines defined 22 to be world accessible because the AMI needs to be able to access your machine  
>     If you SSH_PORT is 1035 and your laptop IP is 111.111.111.111 then you will need a TCP rule with "CIDR 0.0.0.0/0 22"
         
You can see in this image that port 1035 is be opened up to the ip address of my laptop 111.111.111.111/32  
You can see in this image that port 22 is about to be opened up to the ip address of 0.0.0.0/0        
         
>     Save the security group and then you can see it listed:

&nbsp;

7) 
         
>     You now need to start an EC2 instance picking a Debian or Ubuntu AMI in this case, Ubuntu 20.04  
         
![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/awstutorial/image13.png "AWS Tutorial Image 13") 
         
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
         
>     Select your machine size

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/awstutorial/image14.png "AWS Tutorial Image 14") 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
         
>     Review your build machines configuration
         
![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/awstutorial/image15.png "AWS Tutorial Image 15") 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
         
>    Paste your userdata script you made a copy of and modified earlier into the userdata area (scroll down to the advanced area options)
         
![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/awstutorial/image16.png "AWS Tutorial Image 16") 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;         
         
>     Review and Launch your build machine


--------------

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

8) Once the machine has built you can access it as follows:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

>     Discover what the machine's IP address is by looking at the AWS GUI system for the IP address of the build machine - In this case: 185.19.29.134

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

Now on your laptop issue the command:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p ${BUILDCLIENT_SSH_PORT} $BUILDCLIENT_USER@<buildmachineip>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

or yours might be:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     ssh -i /home/${username}/.ssh/id_rsa -p ${BUILDCLIENT_SSH_PORT} $BUILDCLIENT_USER@<buildmachineip>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

Once logged in to your build machine

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     sudo su 
>     [sudo] password for agile-deployer:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

And then enter your build machine password

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

>     ${BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD}

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;


Run through the commands as shown on your laptop to access your build machine
