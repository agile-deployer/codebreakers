### PRE BUILD PREPARATIONS FOR EXPEDITED AND FULL BUILDS:

Before performing an expedited or full build, you need to set up a build machine. The way you do this for Exoscale is as follows:

----------------

1) If you don't have an SSH key pair or if you want a specific SSH key pair for your builds, issue the following command:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
>     /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

Your key will be saved to the indicated file, for example, **/root/.ssh/id_rsa** your path might be different such as **/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa**
	 
Issue the command (for example)

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 	 
>     /bin/cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - this will be your <ssh-public-key-substance>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 	 
This will give you your **public** key which you need later so, take a copy of the output that is printed to the screen.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

--------------------
	
2) Take a copy of the script: [Initial Script](https://github.com/agile-deployer/agile-infrastructure-build-client-scripts/blob/master/templatedconfigurations/templateoverrides/OverrideScriptLinode.sh) and make a stack sript out of it which will look like:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

------------------
	
3) If you want to deploy a machine (debian of ubuntu) using the stack script that you made in 2, you need to populate the following variables in your copy:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
	
>     BUILDMACHINE_USER=""  (for example agile-deployer)
>     BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD=""  (Make sure the password is complex enough to satisfy any strength checks that the OS performs)
>     BUILDMACHINE_SSH_PORT="" (for example 1056)
>     LAPTOP_IP=""   (www.whatsmyip.com)
	
>     SSH=\"\"  (the public key that you installed on your laptop as a key pair in 1)
	
Once you deploy your linode using the stack script from 2 it will look something like the following and you need to populate the variables required as you would for any other Stack Script on Linode.

Select a machine image to build, a region and a machine size (most probably quite a small machine)

Then enter a root password, make sure it is complex enough to satisfy any strength checks built into the OS

Then switch on private networking

4)  If you are sure that all your variables are set correctly in the stack script you have created, you can now actually deploy a Linode using it and it will install the agile deployment toolkit on it.  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

--------------- 
	
6) Add a firewall to your build machine linode cutting off all but the SSH port and Ping from the ip address of your laptop. In other words, the only machine which has any access to your build machine linode is your own laptop through ssh and ping.
	
For SSH, do as follows for the ip address of your laptop:  

![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/linodetutorial/image6.png "Linode Tutorial Image 6") 

	
For Ping, do as follows for the ip address of your laptop:  

![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/linodetutorial/image7.png "Linode Tutorial Image 7")  
	
--------------------

5) You can access your build machine now as follows:
	
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
	
>     Discover what the machine's IP address is by looking at the Linode GUI system for the IP address of the build machine - 212.71.248.95
	
![](https://www.codebreakers.uk/images/linodetutorial/image8.png "Linode Tutorial Image 8") 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
	
Now on your laptop issue the command:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p ${BUILDCLIENT_SSH_PORT} $BUILDCLIENT_USER@<buildmachineip>

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
	
or yours might be:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;
	
>     ssh -i /home/${username}/.ssh/id_rsa -p ${BUILDCLIENT_SSH_PORT} $BUILDCLIENT_USER@<buildmachineip>	

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

Once logged in to your build machine

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

>     sudo su 
>     [sudo] password for agile-deployer:

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;

And then enter your build machine password

&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 	

>     ${BUILDMACHINE_PASSWORD}

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;		
	
On the command line of your laptop it looks like the following:
