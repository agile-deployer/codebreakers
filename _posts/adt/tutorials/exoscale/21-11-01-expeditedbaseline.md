If you have followed the tutorial here, then you will have an active Joomla, or possibly Wordpress, Drupal or Moodle installation active through your web browser.
What you need to do now is to customise your version of (Joomla) so that it is a specialised application for example a blog or a social network and so on. 

What I have done for this tutorial is install a very simple application using a tool called "Community Builder" which you can find here: [Community Builder](www.joomlapolis.com). Literally all I have done is install the latest version (at the time) into my Joomla installation that I installed earlier. 

The next thing I have to do is to generate a baseline of my application so that the baseline can be redeployed. A baseline is stored with whatever git provider you have set in your template when you made your deployment. In my case my git account is my "adt-demos" account with Github.
