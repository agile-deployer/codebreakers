    <p>Support for deployment to multiple cloud hosts. Currently, Digital Ocean, Exoscale, Linode, Vultr and AWS. If you develop a problem or issue with the cloud host you have deployed to, simply perform a frictionless redeploy to another of the supported VPS cloud host providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Easily choose the machine sizes that you want to deploy to, depending on what capacity you need</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deploy to Ubuntu or Debian with extensibility of the scripts to other flavours of Linux taken into consideration</p>

    <p>The Agile Deployment Toolkit is designed to have a core of functionality, which can be thoroughly tested and well maintained, but, it is also designed to be extensible outside of the core so that it is flexible enough to support an arbitrary set of solutions as are required by the users of the toolkit.</p>
