            "content": "BACKGROUND PHILOSOPHY . In another life, I was a consultant for a big IT outsourcing company used by the government for a lot of projects that they needed doing. The problem was the social disconnect. The users of the systems lived on a different planet to those of us building them. So, in order to be a consultant with conviction, I went to actually look or was led into looking by my intuitive self to live as one of the people that uses the systems so that I could actually advise based on experience rather than assumption. Here’s what I found: . The assumption is that people at the arse end of society don’t have much to contribute, that is why you give huge fulough to the middle classes and take 20 quid off those at the arse end because you don’t think you get much bang for your buck from them. That’s a very misled assumption if you actually mixed with people at the arse end of society you would find out that they know more than you and that which end of society is the arse end depends on your social orientation bias not on what it actually is. That was my first lesson which I relay here. . | Secondly, we are moving in to a technocracy and the problem is that the people at the arse end I have worked with or consulted with directly were often technocratically disabled in the sense that they had no experience with technology which excludes them from the technology and therefore the technocracy. Most systems bolt on “accessibility” as an afterthought what I wanted to do is to build systems that had accessibility at their core and therefore lower the barrier to entry to the technology that is available. If you think about it, if you are elderly with visual impairments, or, disabled with mental impairments, or, someone with difficulty reading English, these are all problems that I could see in the big corporate systems that are available ordinarily within the community. So, what I wanted to do is build a system which enables the deployment of social applications, built by developers with the highest commitment to accessibility requirements, that can be deployed and redeployed easily. That is what the Agile Deployment Toolkit is about. It makes it possible to easily deploy simple social networks and other application types that can be used by people who find the regular technologies a bit unwieldy. I can’t solve all problems and I have questions that need answered the same as anyone else does, but, ultimately, that is my finding and that is what I have worked on. . | Built for local people and run by local people. Something else I found is that we have this huge global thing going on and we don’t know who our neighbours are. If you have a problem with one of the big social networks it is next to impossible to get access to “support” because there’s billions of users and so on. If you have hyper local applications they can be run by people who actually live in the same town as you and by doing that, you can have direct access to the techs that run your community site. You can also specialise your applications specifically for the needs of your local community. . | The challenge was to build something useful without much money. Purity of motivation means that youy do it for the love of it and not for the money, so, this is not a big budget attempt here, in fact, there is hardly any budget at all, but, consider that that is what keeps it as pure as possible? . | Another simple philosophy I learnt the hard way is that this is a team effort. Nobody wants to see some bloke at the top of the mountain whilst there are others who are at base camp and that is kind of what has happened with technology. There are people who are at the top of the technology mountain and pushing on further still, I was heading in that direction, but, I got pulled out of that path and had to descend back down to mix and help people who had no technical knowledge at all and that is what you learn, if we are going to become a technocracy we do it together and all of us have a duty to make sure that we do it as a whole team and not as a few gung-ho intrepids. So, what I wanted to do is use some of my technocratic potential to build software that has the potential to include those who were previously excluded. That is functioning as a team and until we do, we won’t make it home (psychologically). You see, once God shows up, He makes it clear to you that your idea of who and who isn’t important might not be the same as his idea of who is and who isn’t important. That’s a tough lesson. . | To sum up my learnt philisophy then, I want to build hyper local applications that can be repeatedly deployed, make those applications as good as possible by having the very best CMS based talent develop them with accessibility in mind and have a consistent process for deploying the same application multiple times, for example, for town A, town B, town C and so on. .",

            "content": "Agile Deployer . Is shared hosting not the ideal solution for your web hosting? . Do you want to have your own set of configured VPS servers but do not want to spend the time configuring and deploying software on them? . Do you want to have consistent security processes baked in to your server deployments? . Would you like to be able to redeploy to a different (supported) VPS host easily - within 20 minutes or so, if you needed to? . Does automated server configuration with the latest releases of software included for each deployment sound attractive? . Would you like a low barrier to entry solution using nothing but basic scripting techniques? . Then you might be interested in the Agile Deployment Toolkit which currently supports Joomla, Wordpress, Moodle and Drupal CMS applications. . Motivation: You can find lots of tutorials online which show how to install and configure server machines using products such as Apache, Nginx, Mysql, Postgres and so on. Following these tutorials to build your own server system is time consuming and possibly error prone if, for example, you don’t remember to do everything with regard to security when you build your server, you could have problems. What I decided to do was write some scripts which would automate the building of my servers in a consistent and predictable cross platform way. In this way, popular CMS systems can be deployed starting from scratch with brand new VPS machines in minutes rather than possibly hours or even days providing nothing to the scripts but configuration parameters. For some people, this solution might be a good fit for their server deployments rather than having to follow tutorials and so on. With this method, you still have full access to your VPS systems to tinker with the configuration or you could modify the scripts directly to attain an “other than default” configuration for your server systems. This approach has application backups and so on built in and the scripts are written to be extensible by anyone. . Deploy to any one of several major cloud providers according to your needs. This toolkit uses the term agile to indicate that it’s easy to redeploy to another one of the supported cloud hosts should your current cloudhost not support your needs - in an agile way. This toolkit is ideal for anyone who wants to investigate how to run their own server systems. It gives a unique, consistent way of server deployment which can be reviewed, tweaked and understood in the same way that car enthusiasts might review, tweak and understand the inner workings of their cars. . Many VPS providers out there, don’t necessarily have clear processes for deploying scalable CMS systems, so, maybe, if that’s the case, this might help. This toolkit is built from the ground up to be extensible so, if you have a use case or requirement that it doesn’t fulfil, you are welcome to fork the repositories and extend as your needs demand. There’s many many PHP applications out there and almost certainly with appropriate extensions to these scripts they can be deployed and operated at scale. The design pattern here is essentially akin to a CMS system’s design in that I write and maintain a core set of scripts and other developers, if they choose to, can extend the scripts to meet additional needs or requirements. . OBJECTIVE: To provide a well written and designed toolkit which facilitates repeated bespoke CMS application deployments to various VPS providers with customised branding using nothing but command line configuration options. . NOTE: I am open to all improvement suggestions and the toolkit has been written to be easily extensible in all regards, so you are free to extend this toolkit to meet your own needs should your requirements fall outside that which is already supported. . Below is a list of VPS cloud hosts that this toolkit currently supports. . .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.
