            "content": "BACKGROUND PHILOSOPHY . In another life, I was a consultant for a big IT outsourcing company used by the government for a lot of projects that they needed doing. The problem was the social disconnect. The users of the systems lived on a different planet to those of us building them. So, in order to be a consultant with conviction, I went to actually look, or, was led into looking by my intuitive self, to interact with the people that use the systems so that I could actually advise based on experience rather than assumption. Here’s what I found: . The assumption is that people who rely on government systems don’t have much to contribute. That’s a very misled assumption if you actually mix with such ones you would find out that they know more than you and that your assumptions about which end of society is the arse end is just that, an assumption and it depends on your social orientation bias not on what it actually is. That was my first lesson which I relay here. . | Secondly, we are moving in to a technocracy and the problem is that the people I have worked with or consulted with directly were often technocratically disabled in the sense that they had no experience with technology which excludes them from the technology and therefore the technocracy. Most systems bolt on “accessibility” as an afterthought what I wanted to do is to build systems that had accessibility at their core and therefore lower the barrier to entry to the technology that is available. If you think about it, if you are elderly with visual impairments, or, disabled with mental impairments, or, difficulties with the English language, these are all problems that I could see in the big corporate systems that are available ordinarily within the community. So, what I wanted to do is build a system which enables the deployment of social applications, built by developers with the highest commitment to accessibility requirements, that can be deployed and redeployed easily. That is what the Agile Deployment Toolkit is about enabling or seeking to enable. It makes it possible to easily deploy simple social networks and other application types that can be used by people who find the regular technologies a bit unwieldy. I can’t solve all problems and I have questions that need answered the same as anyone else does, but, ultimately, that is my finding and that is what I have worked on. Something that this toolkit could be used for might be for coordinating social projects. . | Built for local people and run by local people. Something else I found is that we have this huge global thing going on and we don’t know who our neighbours are. If you have a problem with one of the big social networks it is next to impossible to get access to “support” because there’s billions of users and so on. If you have hyper local applications they can be run by people who actually live in the same town as you and by doing that, you can have direct access to the techs that run your community site. You can also specialise your applications specifically for the needs of your local community. . | The challenge was to build something useful without much money. Purity of motivation means that you do it for the love of it and not just for the money, so, this is not a big budget attempt here, in fact, there is hardly any budget at all, but, consider that that is what keeps it as pure as possible? . | Another simple philosophy I learnt the hard way is that this is a team effort. Nobody wants to see some bloke at the top of the mountain whilst there are others who are at base camp and that is kind of what has happened with technology. There are people who are at the top of the technology mountain and pushing on further still, I was heading in that direction, but, I got pulled out of that path and had to descend back down to mix and help people who had no technical knowledge at all and that is what you learn, if we are going to become a technocracy we do it together and all of us have a duty to make sure that we do it as a whole team and not as a few gung-ho intrepids. So, what I wanted to do is use some of my technocratic potential to build software that has the potential to include those who were previously excluded. That is functioning as a team and until we do, we won’t make it home (psychologically). You see, once God shows up, He makes it clear to you that your idea of who and who isn’t important might not be the same as His idea of who is and who isn’t important. That’s a tough lesson. . | On a grand scale, and, this is philosophical rather than practical, there are two ways to run governments, centralised and decentralised. We can all see that governments are struggling and its no wonder, they are only human. The point of decentralisation (which is what this toolkit (and dare I say it Brexit)) are about is about redressing the power vacuum that monolithic centralied institutions leave at a local level. In other words, if you use a toolkit like this, or, something similar to organise locally that’s as effective a way of governing as anything that is centralised into power titan control systems. In essence, there is a happy medium, kinda not UK, kinda not EU, but more like EUK and that involves hyper local projects and without wanting to undo the government in any way, I think we can all see that if there are tools which can help with local organisation that that is not only good for communities but it is also good for governments. If you do run your social networks locally, then, you have more capacity to monitor what is happening with it. The whole point is that there is no centralisation of anything here, what I have written as a toolkit is just a tool that can be used in the process of leveraging more local influence over the process of social organisation. . | Untapped power base. Maybe I am a freak case but have you ever considered that “none of us have all of the answers but, we all have some of them?”. What this means is that you might be struggling because you just assumed that some sections of society have the answers (universities, schools, companies) and other sections don’t, (the elderly, mental health patients and criminals). Is it beneath you to actually come down off your high horse and make it so that you are open to what others have to say even if perhaps you assumed that you only had things to tell them and they didn’t have anything to tell you? If you start including everyone then you find that everyone has something to add to the mix and if you think they don’t you are not being a wholly person. . | To sum up my learnt philosophy then, I want to build hyper local applications that can be repeatedly deployed, make those applications as good as possible by having the very best CMS based talent develop them with accessibility in mind and have a consistent process for deploying the same application multiple times, for example, for town A, town B, town C and so on. .",

            "content": "Agile Deployment Toolkit . Is shared hosting not the ideal solution for your web hosting? . | Do you want to have your own set of configured VPS servers but do not want to spend the time configuring and deploying software on them? . | Do you want to have consistent security processes baked in to your server deployments? . | Would you like to be able to redeploy to a different (supported) VPS host easily - within 20 minutes or so, if you needed to? . | Does automated server configuration with the latest releases of software included for each deployment sound attractive? . | Would you like a low barrier to entry solution using nothing but basic scripting techniques? . | . Then you might be interested in the Agile Deployment Toolkit which currently supports Joomla, Wordpress, Moodle and Drupal CMS applications. . . MOTIVATION: You can find lots of tutorials online which show how to install and configure server machines using products such as Apache, Nginx, Mysql, Postgres and so on. Following these tutorials to build your own server system is time consuming and possibly error prone if, for example, you don’t remember to do everything with regard to security when you build your server, you could have problems. What I decided to do was write some scripts which would automate the building of my servers in a consistent and predictable way. Using my software, popular CMS systems can be deployed starting from scratch with brand new VPS machines in minutes rather than possibly hours or even days providing nothing to the scripts but configuration parameters. For some people, this solution might be a good fit for their server deployments rather than having to follow tutorials and so on. With this method, you still have full access to your VPS systems to tinker with the configuration, or, you could modify the scripts directly to attain an “other than default” configuration for your server systems. This approach has application backups and so on built in and the scripts are written to be extensible by anyone. . Deploy to any one of several major cloud providers according to your needs. This toolkit uses the term “agile” to indicate that it’s easy to redeploy to another one of the supported cloud hosts should your current cloudhost not support your needs - in an agile way. This toolkit is ideal for anyone who wants to investigate how to run their own server systems. It gives a unique, consistent way of server deployment which can be reviewed, tweaked and understood in the same way that car enthusiasts might review, tweak and understand the inner workings of their cars. The intention is to use this for serious systems, but, learners or students might find it of benefit if they want to experiment with server configurations and so on. . Many VPS providers out there, don’t necessarily have clear processes for deploying scalable CMS systems, so, maybe, if that’s the case, this might help. This toolkit is built from the ground up to be extensible so, if you have a use case or requirement that it doesn’t fulfil, you are welcome to fork the repositories and extend as your needs demand. There’s many many PHP applications out there and almost certainly with appropriate extensions to these scripts they can be deployed and operated at scale. The design pattern here is essentially akin to a CMS system’s design in that I write and maintain a core set of scripts and other developers, if they choose to, can extend the scripts to meet additional needs or requirements. The ultimate aim is to be able to treat whole applications as out of the box solutions. . OBJECTIVE: To provide a well written and designed toolkit which facilitates repeated bespoke CMS application deployments to various VPS providers with customised branding using nothing but command line configuration options. . NOTE: I am open to all improvement suggestions and the toolkit has been written to be easily extensible in all regards, so you are free to extend this toolkit to meet your own needs should your requirements fall outside that which is already supported. . . Below is a list of VPS cloud hosts that this toolkit currently supports. . . . Digital Ocean is a cloudhost that is simple to use and global. They also provide managed databases and so on, so their service offering is growing. .         . . . Exoscale is a Swiss cloudhost, so, if you like the idea of being with a Europe centric cloudhost because their datacentres are either in Switzerland (in decommissioned military nuclear bunkers) or elsewhere within the EU. .         . . . Linode is a cloudhost from the US with global reach. Again, their interfaces are simple and their service offerings are expanding. .         . . . Vultr are a smart cloudhosting company. They seem particularly strong on security to me with processes and so on in place to make sure that things are tied down in terms of security. .         . . . AWS is the world’s largest cloudhost. It also provides a plethora of services such as managed databases and so on which means that your application will be well served if you deploy here.         . .",
