My objective here is to work as “cash free” as possible for as long as possible and to make that the ethos. This approach doesn’t come without challenges because as soon as you approach most people about putting some work in the first question is, “How much are you paying mate?” which can be a blocker because as far as the word on the street goes, “more money good, less money, bad”, but, there’s a lot of grey area in there and you can discover that for yourself. So, to be very clear, you can’t get blood out of a stone and so, if I haven’t got money I can’t pay you money, can I, but, that is not the same as there not being anything in it for you at all. If you haven’t noticed we have gone very cellular. For a lot of us our houses are like little palaces, our luxury cells, and yet when we step outside of our front doors, society is decaying very badly. This means that as our nests get more comfortable society gets more uncomfortable and this means is that ultimately there is a naturally reactive and counterbalancing process of communities becoming more social rather than cellular and me dedicating my life to this is a natural reaction to the mutant culture that has developed and is in play at the moment. That’s not to be judgemental its just to make a point that there’s only so much comfort to go around and when we have more personal comfort it means less social comfort. So, I want you to ask a different question, not, “what is in this for me”, but, “what is in this for society”. Maybe there’s nothing in it. maybe my work is a crock of shit, but, then again, maybe it isn’t, lets find out?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkittechoverview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/adt-techoverview</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Fully automated virgin server configuration and deployment with sensible default webserver and database configuration settings with best practice security guidelines baked in.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/agile-deployment-toolkit</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Toolkit Main Code Repositories</summary></entry></feed>
