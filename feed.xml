My objective here is to work using fiscal leverage as little as possible (I haven’t used it yet, what makes me think I will need to use it in the future)? This approach doesn’t come without challenges and even risks, because, as soon as you approach most people about putting some work in the first question is, “How much are you paying mate?” which can be a blocker because as far as the word on the street goes, “more money good, less money, bad”, but, there’s a lot of grey area in there and you can discover that for yourself. My point is, say, I was doing a talk on online social networking at the local community hall, maybe a few oddballs would show up. But, if I was offering some huge amount like genuinely offering £5000 an hour to everyone that shows up “they” would be queueing down the road to get in. This is what I mean by fiscal leverage. In other words, your capacity to build is constrained by your fiscality, in a lot of cases and if you are “no good with money” that becomes the limiting factor rather than if you are “no good with art”. What I wanted to do then, is, try to build something using as little fiscal leverage as possible. It does make it harder, because I could have a troop of rock star programmers already working with me, if I had the money to buy them, but, because I haven’t, right now, its just me and this idea getting airbourne is proving weighty.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkittechoverview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/adt-techoverview</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Fully automated virgin server configuration and deployment with sensible default webserver and database configuration settings with best practice security guidelines baked in.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/agile-deployment-toolkit</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Toolkit Main Code Repositories</summary></entry></feed>
