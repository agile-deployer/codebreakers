It might therefore be an interesting experiment to see if this project can be gotten off the ground using as little fiscal leverage as possible. I don’t know how it will play put, but, there’s certainly difficulties relating to such an approach because the first question asked upon the “would you like to work on a new startup project” is, “how much are you paying mate?”. Well, I’m not paying money, but, that’s not the same thing as not paying anything at all. There’s lots of ways to capitalise yourself, you can capitalise your love, you can capitalise yourself psychologically, you can capitalise yourself socially, you can capitliae yourself morally and so on. The deception is to make you think the only way of capitalising yourself is fiscally, it isn’t and that is what we can find out for sure.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkittechoverview/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit Tech Overview" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/adt-techoverview</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Fully automated virgin server configuration and deployment with sensible default webserver and database configuration settings with best practice security guidelines baked in.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Agile Deployment Toolkit</title><link href="https://www.codebreakers.uk/agiledeploymenttoolkit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Agile Deployment Toolkit" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://www.codebreakers.uk/agile-deployment-toolkit</id><author><name></name></author><category term="agiledeploymenttoolkit" /><summary type="html">Toolkit Main Code Repositories</summary></entry></feed>
